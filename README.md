# Uninformative Error Message in MATLAB Function

This repository demonstrates a common MATLAB error: an uninformative error message that makes debugging difficult. The function `myFunction` checks for negative inputs, but if a negative input is provided, it throws a generic error message. This message doesn't specify the problem clearly.

The solution shows how to provide a more descriptive error message, making it easier to identify and fix the issue.
